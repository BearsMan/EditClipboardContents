## üîç Main Features

### 1. All-Format Clipboard Inspection
- View every clipboard format currently in use, including:
  - Standard formats (text, images, files)
  - Application-specific formats
  - System and "synthesized" formats
- Display format details such as:
  - Format name and ID
  - Data size
  - Identify likely "synthesized" formats, meaning the system added them automatically
  - Parsed metadata details for certain supported formats like BMP image dimensions
  - Visual indicators for known exportable types
  - Extra information about underlying data structure
- View the object struct info for certain standard formats such as Bitmap formats (CF_BITMAP, CF_DIB, CF_DIBV5)
- View raw data alongside interpreted text in either UTF-8 or UTF-16

### 2. Raw Content Editing
- Edit multiple clipboard objects, then apply pending changes when ready
- Edit clipboard contents at the hexadecimal level
- Real-time plaintext preview of hex edits
   - Support for both UTF-8 and UTF-16 encodings
- Or just remove individual objects/formats
- Load raw data directly from files
- Clear clipboard contents entirely
- Rearrange clipboard format priority order

### 3. Backup and Restore
- Export entire clipboard contents as:
  - ZIP file
  - Folder structure
- Export specific format ranges
- Re-import saved formats from backup

### 4. Add Custom Formats
- Add one or multiple data formats to the clipboard
- Specify a custom name or ID number to use for each
- Edit the raw contents of custom formats just like any other, or even use null data

### 5. Advanced Features
- Timed refresh capability
  - Set custom delay for automatic clipboard refresh
- Progress tracking for format loading
- Debug console available (launch with `-console` argument)
- Presentation of underlying data structures for supported formats
- Manually search for specific formats by format ID or name
  - If the format was already in the list, it will be updated, or otherwise added
  - Good for updating specific formats while preserving the rest

### 6. Export Capabilities
- Text file containing raw data converted to hexadecimal
- Raw data as binary file
  - Some non-standard formats such as PNG just contain the entire file as the raw data, so in such cases exporting it as a file would result in the working PNG image
- Native file export for certain formats
  - Example: The three native bitmap formats (CF_BITMAP, CF_DIB, CF_DIBV5) don't directly contain the same data that would be found by opening a `.bmp` file, but rather the image data as well as other struct metadata. But the app will use the Native Windows API to output each format to a BMP file, and each may be slightly different despite supposedly containing the same image data.
- Export a list of all registered clipboard format names on the system
